  1. Sprint review — what shipped last week
  2. Customer feedback triage
  3. Q2 roadmap priorities
  4. Open discussion
---
section: Sprint Review
---
note: Shipped last week
  Completed 12 of 14 planned stories. Two items carried over:
  *Search redesign* — needs accessibility review, targeting Wednesday
  *API rate limiting* — blocked on infrastructure decision
---
section: Customer Feedback
---
note: Top feedback themes
  Analyzed 47 support tickets and 12 NPS responses:
  *Export functionality* — 15 requests for CSV export from dashboards
  *Mobile experience* — 8 reports of layout issues on tablets
  *Onboarding* — 6 users confused by initial workspace setup
---
section: Decisions
---
note: Decision — CSV export priority
  *Decision:* Move CSV export to Sprint 24 as a P1 item.
  *Rationale:* High customer demand, estimated 3 story points.
  *Owner:* Marcus Johnson
---
note: Decision — Mobile fix sprint
  *Decision:* Dedicate 20% of Sprint 24 to tablet layout fixes.
  *Rationale:* Growing mobile usage (23% of traffic).
  *Owner:* Priya Patel
---
section: Action Items
---
step: Schedule accessibility review for search redesign
| owner: Alex Kim
| due: March 17, 2026
  Coordinate with the accessibility team. Book a 30-minute review session.
---
step: Draft CSV export spec
| owner: Marcus Johnson
| due: March 18, 2026
  Write a one-page spec covering file format, column selection, and size limits.
---
step: Audit tablet layout issues

| version: 1.0
---
note: Overview
  Add real-time push notifications to the web and mobile apps.
  Users receive instant updates for mentions, assignment changes,
  and status updates without polling.
---
section: Requirements
---
note: Functional requirements
  *FR-1:* Deliver notifications within 2 seconds of the triggering event
  *FR-2:* Support web push, mobile push (iOS + Android), and in-app
  *FR-3:* Users can configure notification preferences per event type
  *FR-4:* Batch low-priority notifications into a 5-minute digest
  *FR-5:* Mark as read/unread, with bulk actions
---
note: Non-functional requirements
  *NFR-1:* Handle 10,000 concurrent WebSocket connections per node
  *NFR-2:* 99.9% delivery rate for critical notifications
  *NFR-3:* Maximum 50ms added latency to the triggering action
  *NFR-4:* Graceful degradation — fall back to polling if WebSocket fails
---
section: Architecture
---
note: System design
  *Event bus:* Redis Streams for event ingestion and fan-out
  *WebSocket server:* Dedicated Node.js service with Socket.IO
  *Push service:* Firebase Cloud Messaging for mobile, Web Push API for browsers
  *Storage:* PostgreSQL for notification records, Redis for online presence
  *Queue:* Bull queue for batch digest processing
---
note: Data flow
  1. Service emits event to Redis Stream
  2. Notification worker consumes event, resolves recipients
  3. For each recipient: check preferences, format message
  4. Online users: push via WebSocket
  5. Offline users: queue push notification
  6. Low-priority: batch into digest queue
---
section: Implementation Plan
---
step: Phase 1 — WebSocket infrastructure
| owner: Backend team
| estimate: 2 weeks
  Set up Socket.IO server. Implement connection management,
  authentication, and reconnection logic. Load test to 10K connections.
---
step: Phase 2 — Event pipeline
| owner: Backend team
| estimate: 1 week
  Configure Redis Streams. Build the notification worker service.
  Implement preference checking and message formatting.
---
step: Phase 3 — Client integration
| owner: Frontend team
| estimate: 2 weeks
  Add notification bell UI. Implement WebSocket client with
  automatic reconnection. Build notification preferences panel.
---
step: Phase 4 — Mobile push
| owner: Mobile team
| estimate: 1 week
  Integrate FCM for Android and iOS. Handle token registration
  and refresh. Test across OS versions.
---
section: Risks
---
note: Risk assessment
  *High:* WebSocket scaling under peak load — mitigate with horizontal scaling and connection limits
  *Medium:* Push notification delivery on iOS — mitigate with APNs best practices and retry logic
  *Low:* Redis single point of failure — mitigate with Redis Sentinel failover

section: Highlights
---
note: Dashboard redesign shipped
  Launched the new analytics dashboard to 100% of users on Tuesday.
  Initial feedback positive — 4.2/5 in-app rating from 230 responses.
  Page load time improved by 40% with the new data fetching approach.
---
note: Search performance optimization
  Reduced search query time from 820ms to 210ms by adding
  composite indexes and query plan optimization. Deployed Thursday.
---
section: Blockers and Risks
---
note: API rate limiting — blocked
  Waiting on infrastructure team's decision on rate limiting strategy.
  Options: API gateway (Kong) vs application-level (custom middleware).
  *Impact:* Delays the partner API launch by 1 week if not resolved by Friday.
  *Action:* Escalated to VP Engineering. Decision meeting scheduled Thursday.
---
note: Database migration risk
  The user table migration for multi-tenancy is estimated at 4 hours
  of downtime. Exploring zero-downtime migration with shadow tables.
  *Action:* Proof of concept by next Wednesday.
---
section: Next Week Plan
---
step: Complete API rate limiting
| owner: Platform team
  Implement the chosen rate limiting strategy. Target: ready for QA by Wednesday.
---
step: Start notification system
| owner: Backend team
  Begin Phase 1 of the real-time notifications project.
  Set up WebSocket infrastructure and connection management.
---
step: Mobile layout fixes
